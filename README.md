# jekyll-gpx-converter demo site

This is a demo website for [jekyll-gpx-converter](https://github.com/mhaulo/jekyll-gpx-converter).

See how files in `_rides` are regular gpx files with no front matter. Still Jekyll - or jekyll-gpx-converter - converts them into viewable documents.

This demo site is built on top of the [Tale theme](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. cd into the theme directory and run `bundle`
3. Start Jekyll server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Head over to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ to see the site in action.
